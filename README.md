# Hi, I’m Thaphashree 👋  

I’m an **Electronics Engineering undergraduate (VLSI specialization)** at **VIT Vellore**, exploring how **hardware, signal processing, and embedded systems** come together to solve real-world problems.

I enjoy learning by building — from FPGA-based digital systems to embedded projects and signal processing applications — and I’m actively looking for **internship and entry-level opportunities** where I can grow as an engineer.

---

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning
- Digital & hardware design using **Verilog HDL**
- FPGA implementation and testing
- Signal processing concepts and real-time systems
- Embedded systems using **ESP32**

## 🔧 Projects I’ve Worked On

### 🧪 Digital Logic Gates IC Tester (FPGA – DE2-115)
This project started as a way to reduce the time spent manually checking ICs in the lab.  
I designed a **hardware-based IC tester** using **Verilog on an FPGA**, which reduced verification time by **around 80%**.  
The project was showcased at **Electroutsav 2025**.

### 🎧 Real-Time Voice Clarity Booster
I built a **speech enhancement system** using the **Wiener filter** to improve audio clarity in noisy environments.  
The system achieved **10–15 dB noise reduction**, and helped me understand practical signal processing beyond theory.

### 🚪 Automatic Door Locking System (ESP32)
An embedded system that **counts room occupancy** using **dual ultrasonic sensors**.  
The door locks automatically when no one is inside, combining sensor logic with real-world automation using an **ESP32**.
